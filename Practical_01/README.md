# Practical 1: Linear Regression with Synthetic Data

## Aim
To implement linear regression using TensorFlow.js with synthetic data.

## Tools Used
- HTML
- JavaScript
- TensorFlow.js (CDN)

## Description
This practical includes:
1. Pre-trained fixed synthetic data (y = 2x)
2. Self-generated synthetic data (y = 3x + 5)

The model is created using tf.sequential() and tf.layers.dense().
